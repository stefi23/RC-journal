**What I've done 👯🏿‍♀️**

- Completed: - [Project Euler: Problem 3 - Largest Prime-Factor](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-3-largest-prime-factor])
  ✨[My solution ](project-Euler-FCG/Problem3-Largest-prime-factor.js) - [Project Euler: Problem 3 - Largest Palindrome Product](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-4-largest-palindrome-product)
  ✨Paired with Jana on this one. [Our solution ](project-Euler-FCG/Problem4-largestPalindromeProduct.js)
- Created this [repository](https://github.com/stefi23/RC-journal/blob/master/README.md) to keep track of my journey at RC
- Attended Pair Programming Workshop
- Complete the UI Design Fundamentals [UI Design Fundamentals](https://scrimba.com/g/gdesign?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=gdesign_mainlist_launch) course on Scrimba
- Created a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in React (to be deployed) [Code on Github](https://github.com/stefi23/Schere-Stein-Papier)
- Did some more katas on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/stefi23) ([repository with solutions](Codewars)), a couple even on Python

- After checking the options for a static websites I decided to go for [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) by choosing Gatsby I will possibly improve my JavaScript (or TypeScript even) and React skills.

- Let fear show up but not listen to it
- Completed the Week 1 challenge on the [Leet Code 30 Days Challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/)
  [My Solutions](Leet-Code-Challange)

**Challenges 🐘**

- Trying to organize my day to make the most out of it
- Minimize screen time and regularly take walking or stretching breaks
- Figure out how to navigate the time zone difference
- Learning how to take notes digitally and organize them

**What I've learned 💡**

- For every challenge start small, first implement the easiest slowest version and then improve it.
- Becoming more comfortable using the `reduce()` method in Javascript 💃
- Discovered [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) with which I wrote this MD file and it's pretty cool as I can add 🙈 emojis
- I've learned about [headless CMS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/headless-cms/) and static websites
- A bit of Python syntax and some ways it's different in from Javascript
- That I can build something in React from scratch on my own without following a tutorial
- Learn a lot of intresting facts about time zones and soon I will prepare a presentation sharing all of these
- Setting goals at the beginning of the week helps me stay focused
- Journaling and keeping track of what I am working on makes me be more aware of my progress

**Notes/Links 🗒️**

- [Max Sub-Array Sum (Javascript)](https://medium.com/@IndiraWilliams/max-sub-array-sum-javascript-f1303f979344)
- Paired with [Jimmy Tang (he)](https://github.com/talyian) and found it quite useful to use `start` and `end` when doing a nested loop:

```
function getSubarrays(arr) {
  for(var start = 0; start < arr.length; start++) {
    for(var end = 0; end < arr.length; end++) {
      console.log(start,end)
    }
  }
}
getSubarrays([1,2,3])
```

- Dear developers part of underrepresented groups, little future developers who look or act or dress or think as you need you to blog more 🙈
  Please, blog and talk at events and meetups. We need you 🙏 [Good article](http://garann.com/dev/2013/how-to-blog-about-code-and-give-zero-fucks/)
