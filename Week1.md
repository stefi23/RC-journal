  ✨[My solution ](project-Euler-FCG/Problem3-Largest-prime-factor.js) - [Project Euler: Problem 3 - Largest Palindrome Product](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-4-largest-palindrome-product)
  ✨Paired with Jana on this one. [Our solution ](project-Euler-FCG/Problem4-largestPalindromeProduct.js)
- Created this [repository](https://github.com/stefi23/RC-journal/blob/master/README.md) to keep track of my journey at RC
- Attended Pair Programming Workshop
- Complete the UI Design Fundamentals [UI Design Fundamentals](https://scrimba.com/g/gdesign?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=gdesign_mainlist_launch) course on Scrimba
- Created a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in React (to be deployed) [Code on Github](https://github.com/stefi23/Schere-Stein-Papier)
- Did some more katas on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/stefi23) ([repository with solutions](Codewars)), a couple even on Python

- Minimize screen time and regularly take walking or stretching breaks
- Figure out how to navigate the time zone difference
- Learning how to take notes digitally and organize them

**What I've learned 💡**

- For every challenge start small, first implement the easiest slowest version and then improve it.
- Becoming more comfortable using the `reduce()` method in Javascript 💃
- Discovered [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) with which I wrote this MD file and it's pretty cool as I can add 🙈 emojis
- I've learned about [headless CMS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/headless-cms/) and static websites
- A bit of Python syntax and some ways it's different in from Javascript
- That I can build something in React from scratch on my own without following a tutorial
- Learn a lot of intresting facts about time zones and soon I will prepare a presentation sharing all of these
