**Challenges 🐘**

**What I've learned 💡**

> Today I've learned that the **spread operator in JS** `[...variable]` allows an iterable such as an **array** but also **a string** to copied into an array.
>
> Thing you cannot do with the `split()` method as this method is used to split a **string** only into an **array** of substrings, and returns the new **array**I hope I got it right.I've found this useful while doing a kata where the argument received was either a string or an array and I needed it to be an array.
>
> Also there is the `Array.isArray(variable) - return true or false` to check if a variable is an array.
