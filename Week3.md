**What I've done 👯🏿‍♀️**

- Completed Katas:

  - [Extract the domain name from a URL](https://www.codewars.com/kata/514a024011ea4fb54200004b)

- Create a [REST API Node.js project](https://github.com/stefi23/weather-app) with the following endpoints:

  - Endpoint that receives an address and validate if its valid. This address must be in an object with the properties street, streetNumber, town, postalCode and country. (HereMaps API)
  - Endpoint that receives an address, validate it and check the weather for the lat/lon of that address. (HereMaps API and OpenWeather API)

- Watched 1st lecture from [A Practical Guide to Algorithms with JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/)

**Challenges 🐘**

**What I've learned 💡**

- I've learned working with branches in Github. Basically for every feature or change in my projects I add a branch and merge it only afterward. I feel like this is good practice.
- About Time Zones while giving the non-tech talk about time zones
- Learned about Algorithms
