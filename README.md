# RC Journal

Hi! I decided to keep a journal on GitHub to track what I will be working on as well as doing while at the **Recurse Center **.

## Week 1

**Planned 🤸**

- Do 1/2 challenge from Project Euler on FreeCodeCamp and more small ones from other websites
- Read about Ghost, Gatsby, Eleventy and other static Websites and figure out what you will use to create a personal blog
- Start working on a personal blog
- Create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in React ( this [tutorial](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH) could help)
- Complete the UI Design Fundamentals [UI Design Fundamentals](https://scrimba.com/g/gdesign?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=gdesign_mainlist_launch) course on Scrimba
- Try to pair with someone
- Be social, reach out to others, participate in coffee chats ☕

**Meetings I want to attend 🗽**

- Pair Programming Workshop
- Feelings Check-In
- Maybe Algorithms Study Group
- Maybe Creative Coding Group

  **What I've done 👯🏿‍♀️**

- Completed: [Project Euler: Problem 3 - Largest Prime-Factor](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-3-largest-prime-factor])
  ✨[My solution ](project-Euler-FCG/Problem3-Largest-prime-factor.js)
- Created this [repository](https://github.com/stefi23/RC-journal/blob/master/README.md) to keep track of my journey at RC
- Attended Pair Programming Workshop where I worked on the
- Complete the UI Design Fundamentals [UI Design Fundamentals](https://scrimba.com/g/gdesign?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=gdesign_mainlist_launch) course on Scrimba
- Participated at non-technical talks which was super intresting and insightful.
  I've found out about an amazing place in Japan that I want to go to - Yakushima Island, and I think it's time to seriously think about trying Backcountry Skiing and journal more. Shean talk made me consider a new system of journaling.
- Had a lovely coffee chat with James where I shared my fascination about Time Zones and he shared with me a converasation going on in Zulip on the topic. I'm thinking talk about it at the non-technical talks next week.

**Challenges 🐘**

- Trying to organize my day to make the most out of it
- Minimize screen time and regularly take walking or stretching breaks
- Figure out how to navigate the time zone difference
- Learning how to take notes digitally and organize them

**What I've learned 💡**

- For every challenge start small, first implement the easiest slowest version and then improve it.
- Becoming more comfortable using the `reduce()` method in Javascript 💃
- Discovered [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) with which I wrote this MD file and it's pretty cool as I can add 🙈 emojis
