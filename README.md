Hi! I decided to keep a journal on GitHub to track what I will be working on as well as doing while at the **Recurse Cener **.

## Week 1

- Do 1/2 challenge from Project Euler on FreeCodeCamp and more small ones from other websites
- Read about Ghost, Gatsby, Eleventy and other static Websites and figure out what you will use to create a personal blog
- Start working on personal blog
- Create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in React ( this [tutorial](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH) could help)
- Complete the UI Design Fundamentals [UI Design Fundamentals](https://scrimba.com/g/gdesign?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=gdesign_mainlist_launch) course on Scrimba
- Try to pair with someone
- Be social, reach out to others, participate in coffee chats ☕

**Meetings I want to attent 🗽**

- Pair Programming Workshop
- Feelings Check-In
- Maybe Algorithms Study Group
- Maybe Creative Coding Group

  **What I've done 👯🏿‍♀️**

- Completed: [Project Euler: Problem 3 - Largest Prime-Factor](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-3-largest-prime-factor])
  ✨[My solution ](project-Euler-FCG/Problem3-Largest-prime-factor.js)
- Created this [repository](https://github.com/stefi23/RC-journal/blob/master/README.md) to keep track of my journey at RC
- Attended Pair Programming Workshop
- Complete the UI Design Fundamentals [UI Design Fundamentals](https://scrimba.com/g/gdesign?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=gdesign_mainlist_launch) course on Scrimba

**Challenges**

- Trying to organize my day to make the most out of it
- Minimize screen time and regularly take walking or streching breaks
- Figure out how to navigage the time zone difference

**What I've learned**

- For every challegenge start small, first implement the easiest slowest version and than improve it.
- Becoming more comfortable using the `reduce()` method in Javascript 💃
- Discovered [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) with which I wrote this md file and it's pretty cool as I can add 🙈 emojis
