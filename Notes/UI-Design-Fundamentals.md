## Personal Hacks

- Use a box-shadow
  border: 0;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 6px 0px;
  hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.2)
- Don't use black for text color instead use a darker gray
- When adding the date make it a bit smaller in caps (text-transform) with a 0.1em letterspacing
- padding on a link to make it look better when it has a background color: 0.7em up&down and 2em left&right

## Notes

- **White spacing** is important; always make sure you add enough padding and marting
- **Alignment**: elements should be aligned with each other
- **Contrast** super important especially for visually impaired people. Make sure you follow the [WCAG 2 Contrast and Color Requirements](<[https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/)>);
- \*\*UI Design App Plugin (Figma, Sketch, and AdobeDX) - to look into if needed
- **Scale** per given layout and various elements
- **Typography** choose max 2 fonts, rather than adding more play with size, colors, weight, and other properties.
- **Visual Hierarchy** make the imporant elements stand out, h1 should be bigger, CTA should be visible especially if there is only one, maybe add a brighter color
- **Color** use it to elicit emotion; avoid using color that don't compliment each other; use slight variances of the same hue/color in terms of lightness or darkness to reinforce different blocks
