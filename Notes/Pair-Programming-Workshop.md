# Pair Programming

On the first week at the RC I've participated at a pair programming workshop. Here are some of my notes.

## Pairing tools

- [repl.it](<[http://repl.it/languages](http://repl.it/languages)>) - various languages
- [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) for JS and NodeJs
- If you use VSCode: [LiveShare Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
- Zoom (you can give control over your mac while sharing) or Google Hang out works as well
- [tuple.app](https://tuple.app/) one I want to try

## Notes

**Pair Programming** - easier to stay focuse - 4 eyes better than 2 - learn more by seing how someone else solves a problem - it's fun as well

It's good to swap every 8-15 minutes; especially if it's done remotely

There are 2 people in pairing:

- **Driver** - typing - programing OUT LOUD - important - focused on the task at hand
- **Navigator**
  -reviewing driver's work - thinking about next steps - asks questions

| DO'S                                       | DON'T'S                                                    |
| :----------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Talk A LOT!                              | - Get defensive                                            |
| - Take 5 min breaks                        | - Forget to swap                                           |
| - Say thank you!                           | - Talk over each other                                     |
| - Use a timer if you want (pomodoro maybe) | - Try to pair on something that is trivial - as it will be |
| - Stay engaged                             |                                                            |
